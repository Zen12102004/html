        <p><blockquote>Petra (Arabic: ٱلْبَتْراء, romanized: Al-Batrāʾ; Greek: Πέτρα, "Rock"), originally known to its inhabitants as Raqmu , is a historic and archaeological city in southern Jordan. Famous for its rock-cut architecture and water conduit systems, Petra is also called the "Rose City" because of the colour of the sandstone from which it is carved.[5] The city is one of the New 7 Wonders of the World and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. </blockquote> </p>
